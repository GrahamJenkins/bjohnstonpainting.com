                                "We reached out to Bill Johnston Painting to paint the interior and exterior of 18 new construction town homes. Bill was very easy to work with and did a great job communicating with us about the status of the project. His price was fair and the quality lived up to our expectations."

He got it done in a timely manner and the price was right too. I can't thank him enough for the wonderful job he did and everyone was very happy with the turnout. I'd definitely refer him to clients, family and friends."
