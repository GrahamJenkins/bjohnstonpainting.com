                        <p>We reached out to Bill Johnston Painting to paint the interior and exterior of 18 new construction townhomes. Bill was very easy to work with and did a great job communicating with us about the status of the project. His price was fair and the quality lived up to our expectations. I will not hesitate to call him when more projects come up.</p>
